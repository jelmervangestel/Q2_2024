The VTT of a traveller reflects the amount of money the traveller is **willing to pay** to reduce their travel time. The VTT is used to determine the benefits of new infrastructure projects. As travel time savings are the dominant and most salient benefits of new infrastructure, accurate inference of the distribution of the VTT is crucial for a rigorous underpinning of policy decisions. <br>\n",

The data set consists of 5,832 participants, resulting in a total of 52,488 choice observations.
