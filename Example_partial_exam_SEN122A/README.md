Partial exam 1 aims to assess your modelling skills, not your Python syntax knowledge. <br>
Therefore, we will provide you with the following files during the exam:
- All Lab session notebooks with the correct answers provided by us (in HTML format)
- All tutorial notebooks (in HTML format)
- Chi-square table (pdf)
- Formula cheat sheet (pdf)
<br>
The exam will take place in one of TUD’s computer halls, and you will complete it on a university computer. You cannot access the internet, ChatGPT or any other online resource. You can access Jupyter Notebook, Python, Excel, and Notepad in the digital exam environment.
<br><br>
The main focus of the exam lies on weeks 1 and 2 (MNL + Mixed Logit). You will not be asked to train a data-driven choice model (week 3). However, conceptual questions about week 3 can be part of the exam.
