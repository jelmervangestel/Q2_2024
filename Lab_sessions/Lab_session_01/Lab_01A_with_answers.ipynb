    "AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Co-pilot, are great tools to assist with programming. Moreover, in your later careers, you will work in a world where such tools are widely available. As such, we **encourage** you to use AI tools **effectively**. However, be careful not to overestimate the capacity of AI tools! AI tools cannot replace you: you still have to conceptualise the problem, dissect it and structure it to conduct proper analysis. We recommend being especially **reticent** with using AI tools for the more conceptual and reflection-oriented questions. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab session, we will analyse neighbourhood location choice behaviour. Understanding people's preferences over neighbourhood characteristics is crucial for city planners when they (re)develop neighbourhoods or devise policies to tackle e.g. residential segregation. During this lab session, you will apply discrete choice models to uncover people's preferences over attributes, such as the distance to the city centre and the share of foreigners in their neighbourhood. Also, you will explore whether preferences interact with covariates such as age, gender, home ownership, car ownership and urbanisation level. While doing so, you will test various utility specifications and interpret the modelling outcomes of discrete choice models.\n",
